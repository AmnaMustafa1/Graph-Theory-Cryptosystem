# 🔐 Graph Theory-Based Cryptographic System Using Path-Encoding

A unique approach to encryption that replaces traditional static transformations with dynamic graph path encoding. This lightweight and unpredictable model aims to enhance data security, particularly for embedded systems and next-gen applications.

## 🧠 Project Overview

In today's digital age, traditional encryption methods such as **RSA** and **AES** follow predictable mathematical structures. Our system introduces an innovative alternative: representing binary data as **graph-based paths**, making it significantly harder to breach and ideal for environments with limited computational power.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ **Graph-Based Key Generation**
- ✅ **Path Encoding for Binary Data**
- ✅ **Unpredictable Encryption Flow**
- ✅ **Lightweight and Scalable**
- ✅ Suitable for future extensions like **Image/Audio encryption**

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- C++
- Graph Theory
- Data Structures
- File Handling

## 📂 How It Works

1. **Input Message** ➝ Converted to **7-bit binary**
2. **Graph** is generated dynamically with custom keys
3. Binary stream is **encoded as a path** across the graph
4. Encrypted data is stored and decoded using reverse path tracking
